In the data files, the HIT column (in all caps) were generated from the Eyelink eyetracker and are inaccurate. As such, for our analyses, we referred to the KEYBOARD_RESPONSE_KEY column (key that participant pressed) and compared it to the target_key column (generated during the trial randomization procedure).

This is reflected in the R script, in eyelinkR/R/read_data.R (line 76)

To avoid confusion, we have uploaded an updated version of the data files. In these files there is an additional column, trial_hit. This is generated in Excel using [KEYBOARD_RESPONSE_KEY = target_key]. The column thus holds Boolean values that represent whether there was a hit (participant responded correctly) during that particular trial.

The following files were added:
expt1a_data_with_hit.csv
expt1b_data_with_hit.csv
expt2_data_with_hit.csv

Thank you to Andrew Heathcote and Talira Kucina for highlighting this confusion to us.
