This project examined whether the log slopes observed in
Buetti et al. (2016) were still seen when subjects were not
allowed to move their eyes.

Data from Eyelink are in the individual experiment folders.

Individual R scripts are used for each experiment due to slightly
different parameters. These R scripts rely on a package that I
wrote (eyelinkR). To install this package, run the installation.R file inside that folder.
